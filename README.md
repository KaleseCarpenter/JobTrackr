# Job-Trackr-CRUD-App

I built a web application today from scratch called Job Trackr.

I created this application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with the purpose of helping other fellow 
engineers and applicants easily track all of their job submissions, offers, and rejections. 

The applicaton allows you to add, edit and delete entries for the options below:
-Company name
-Position Title
-Date Applied
-Method of Application
-Salary
-City / State
-Status

I built the wireframe in a sketchpad first and then I wrote out the Psuedo Code for the JavaScript to break it down in smaller chunks.
I applied CRUD functions to this project to give users the ability to make updates as the job process progresses.
I also implimented key frames in my CSS so the title text changes colors when you hover over it.

I will continue to add new features to this app because I know it will be a useful tool to keep my life more organized and make this software engineering journey less of a hassle.
